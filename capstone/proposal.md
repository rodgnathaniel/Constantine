## Constantine ##

...

Constant,
steadfast,
dependable,
true.
Named in loving memory of my good friend Constantine Gorbachev who passed away this 
last November. 

# Overview #

For my Capstone project I plan to manipulate the speech to text web-kits through
JavaScript in order to create a simulated boat that can be controlled with 
verbal commands. There will be a Django registration / login system to keep track of
users account information, including their user-names, high scores, and personal  in
game achievements. 

# Functionality #

Have you ever played a relaxing puzzle game and enjoyed it?
Sick and tired of 'shoot-em-up' violence and fast paced nonsense?
...
Take a trip on the S.S. Constantine; today you're the captain! All the crew members
are in need of your nautical expertise, bravery, and guidance.

The goal is simple, command the virtual boat with your voice or your keyboard and
bring your crew back to land safely. Maybe you'll even find some treasure along
the way!

# Data Model #

The goal is to be non invasive. You do not need to an account to play Constantine.
...
Though, in order to keep track of your high scores and progress within the game you can 
become a registered user. 
If you choose this route you will have the ability to create a captain's name unique 
to you! 
Then we will be able to store your best puzzle solving times in our data base along
with your win to loss ratio etc.

   The first goal is to create the user registration and login system as well as an
   aesthetically pleasing environment that is friendly to anyone navigating the 
   web page. Before we set sail, I need to get my sea legs by having a timer start
   when the game begins; the user then will be prompted to give a vocal command that 
   changes the color of an object on the screen. When the task is complete the timer
   will stop and this time will be recorded into the database within the users model.

   The second goal would be to take the object manipulation a step further by placing
   a boat (object) inside canvas and having it move around with vocal commands.
   (Example: north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest, etc)
   If the user can move the boat to certain location on the canvas the timer will stop
   and their time will be recorded into the database.

   The third goal will be raise the bar for the games difficulty. The ocean is a
   dangerous and unpredictable environment, so possible challenges such as currents that
   move the boat, pirates to avoid, or even vocal challenges like having to say a
   tongue twister or answer a riddle before you can reach land.
   
# -4- # 

   If all these goals can be achieved within the projects time constraints, the next step
   would be to create a point gathering system. Instead of just reaching land the user
   will also be focused on navigating the boat in  a way that gathers the most points.
